using chromedriver 84

selenium is some wierd stuff. the chrome opts arg works with selenium version 3.0.0 but not with others.
but 3.0.0 isnt compatible with current version of chrom (84 as of sep 18 2020)

also note that 3.0.0 is `chrome_options`
3.10.0 onwards its deprecated and should use `options` instead
